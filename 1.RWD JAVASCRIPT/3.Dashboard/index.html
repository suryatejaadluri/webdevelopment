Bridge (Welsh: Pont Trefynwy) in Monmouth, Wales, is the only remaining fortified river bridge in Great Britain with its gate tower standing on the bridge. It crosses the River Monnow 500 metres (1,600 ft) above its confluence with the River Wye. According to tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a Norman timber bridge. Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the Chartist uprising, the bridge played a significant role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a toll gate, a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, and a focus for celebrations. Built predominantly of Old Red Sandstone, the bridge was significantly reconstructed in the 18th and 19th centuries. It then also became a popular subject for artists such as Turner. In the 20th century, it suffered damage from accidents and heavy traffic. After a new road bridge was built downstream in 2004, use of the Monnow Bridge was restricted to pedestrians. Its historical and architectural importance are reflected in its status as a Scheduled Monument and a Grade I listed building. (Full article...)

          Web browsers are extremely capable graphics platforms with the ability to manipulate fonts, colors, shapes and even animations. The file format that controls these is cascading style sheets (CSS).

Understanding CSS is a fundamental skill for the modern web developer, whether you're creating static pages from scratch, generating dynamic pages with a framework or designing a blog theme. This learning path will take you from the basics of CSS to a live coding session that explains the mixing of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

1. Read instructions for each function carefully.
2. Feel free to create new functions if needed. Give good names though :)
3. Use builtins and datatypes that we have seen so far.
4. If something about the function spec is not clear, use the corresponding test
   for clarification.
5. Many python builtin functions allow you to pass functions to customize their behavior. This makes it very productive
   to get things done in python.

Write your own implementation of converting a number to a given base. It is important to have a good logical

Till now, we were glossing over error checking, for this function do proper error checking and raise exceptions
as appropriate.
