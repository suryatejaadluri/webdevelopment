-- Create simple web pages with ajax calls. Go through with ajax online tutorials and implement in core javascript or jquery . 
Use get, post request handling appropriately with error handling. 

Once you are done with it, use real time sample apis(links below) to get real time data. 
https://reqres.in/  - go through with the documentation to use them
For eg: https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2  - will give u object of users.. 
Like that use all other apis by implementing in your local ajax calls . 

Once you get the data from server using ajax call, display received data in web page in appropriate manner for most of the data. 
Handle error scenarios like if you do not get response from the server, if imrpoper data type sent, if no data found, etc

Committ with new folder and let me know. Once you are free to work with ajax, can give you full web page with dynamic data rendered from server.
